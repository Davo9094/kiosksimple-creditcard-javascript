The following is an example of how to easily parse credit card data from a magnetic stripe reader using JavaScript and KioskSimple.

This is particularly useful when you want to put your website on a kiosk and automatically populate the credit card fields when the customer swipes their card.

By automatically populating the credit card payment fields you reduce the potential for user error and speed up the checkout process.

The following fields are contained in the track data on most credit cards and can be easily parsed from the credit card data using JavaScript when the customer swipes their credit card.

- Cardholderâ€™s Name
- Card Number
- Expiration Date
